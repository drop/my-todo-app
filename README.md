# Description
This is my simple todo app on React+Redux+MaterialUI libs. 

# Install
You will need a parcel bundler besides a node and npm:
```sh
$ npm install -g parcel-bundler
```
# Run app
Start dev server on 8080 port:
```sh
$ npm start
```
On Linux, an error may occur when the parsel is running. To fix it you need:
```sh
$ npm run linux-fix
```
